# D0ToK3piPreparing to use on LXPlus:```pip install --user --upgrade pippip install --user virtualenv virtualenvwrapper```Add the following to your `~/.bashrc` file:```export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvsexport PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/Develsource $HOME/.local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh```After reruning your bashrc, you'll need to make a k3pi environment:```mkvirtualenv k3pi -r requirements.txt```Then you should be able to source setup.sh (I have to copy and paste it to the command line for some unknown reason).
